All prices below include GST (Goods and Services Tax of 15%). If you are outside New Zealand, GST does not apply to my services.

The following is a guide to pricing for frequently ordered translations in New Zealand Dollars:

* Driver’s licence translation (NZTA format): $45
* Family registration certificate – selective translation: $51.75 for up to three family members
* Birth certificate – selective translation: $51.75
* Full translations: Rates vary depending on the document, but are charged per Japanese character. Minimum charge applies.

Minimum charge: With the exception of driver’s licence translations, all translations have a minimum charge of $51.75 (for documents less than 300 Japanese characters).

Urgent fees may apply if you require a fast turnaround.

Translations are produced as PDF files. A small additional charge applies for hard copies.

My preferred payment method is direct bank transfer to my NZ bank account, but other options are available upon request.

The above rates are subject to change, so please email info@kuakatranslations.co.nz for a quote.

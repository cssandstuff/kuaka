# Privacy policy

## Introduction

Elizabeth Sekizaki (trading as Kuaka Translations) complies with the New Zealand Privacy Act 1993 (the Act) when dealing with personal information. Personal information is information about an identifiable individual (a natural person).
This policy sets out how I will collect, use, disclose, store and protect your personal information.
This policy does not limit or exclude any of your rights under the Act. If you wish to seek further information on the Act, see [www.privacy.org.nz](http://www.privacy.org.nz).

## Changes to this policy

I may change this policy by uploading a revised policy onto the website. The change will apply from the date that I upload the revised policy.

## Collection of personal information

I collect personal information about you from:
you, when you provide that personal information to me, including via the website and any related service, through any registration or subscription process, through any contact with me (e.g. telephone call or email), or when you request or purchase my services
third parties where you have authorised this or the information is publicly available.
If possible, I will only collect personal information from you directly.

## How I use your personal information

I will use your personal information to perform the services you request or to take necessary steps prior to fulfilling that request, and to comply with legal requirements.
I hold information on clients, suppliers, collaborators, information processors and potential clients for legitimate interests.
Personal information may include your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, tax or ID number, payment and delivery conditions, or financial and bank account details.
I collect, store and use such personal information for the purposes of issuing a quotation, providing any translation, editing, revision or consulting services that you request and consent to, invoicing or receiving payment, and verification of name spellings or other text ambiguities. I may also collect, store and use such personal information for providing reprints of translations, complying with legal and taxation requirements, or I may store anonymised texts for my own future reference.
I will not use your personal information for marketing purposes that are not relevant to our business relationship. I may use it to respond to any communications from you (including a complaint), to inform you of any future promotions or updates to my services, to communicate with you following the completion of a service in order to request feedback or reviews, improve my services and processes or to optimise your experience in the case of ongoing collaborations. I may also use this information to protect and/or enforce my legal rights and interests, including defending any claim, or for any other purpose authorised by you or the relevant legislation.
The information in question will be retained throughout the business relationship only, or for the length of time stipulated to comply with legal or taxation obligations, or for any other purpose authorised by you or the Act.

## Disclosing your personal information

I may disclose your personal information to a trusted colleague for revision, editing and translation services, and for clerical or administrative support. I may also disclose your personal information to a person who requires me to supply your personal information (such as a regulatory authority), any other person authorised by the relevant legislation or another law (such as a law enforcement agency) or any other person authorised by you.
A business that supports my services may be located outside New Zealand. This may mean that your personal information is held and processed outside New Zealand. Other parties that may have access to your personal information for administrative purposes include my website/email hosting service, website form service, PayPal, online accounting or invoicing tools and Google Suite applications.

## Retention of personal information

Information relating to quotes will be retained for up to three months. In cases of work carried out, I am obliged to retain your personal information in electronic format for seven years to comply with local taxation obligations, after which period this information will be deleted. I will also delete email communication after seven years. 
If physical copies of translations and their corresponding source documents containing personal information are not required or requested by clients, these will be destroyed within one month of their date of issue.

## Protecting your personal information

I will take reasonable steps to keep your personal information safe from loss, unauthorised activity, or other misuse, including:

* Updates to the software and hardware used for storing and processing personal information
* Installing anti-virus software/firewalls on the equipment used for storing and processing personal information
* Using passwords in all electronic systems in use for storing or processing personal information
* Backing up the personal information on a device other than that used on a day-to-day basis, so that personal information may be recovered in the event of loss or damage.
* In the event of a security breach of personal information due to theft or unlawful access, for example, I will notify the individual(s) affected and the New Zealand Office of the Privacy Commissioner within 72 hours of this security breach. This will include all of the information necessary to clarify the circumstances under which this happened. Notification will be carried out electronically via the online Privacy Commissioner portal.

## Accessing and correcting your personal information

Subject to certain grounds for refusal set out in the Act, you have the right to access your readily retrievable personal information that I hold and to request a correction to your personal information. Before you exercise this right, I will need evidence to confirm that you are the individual to whom the personal information relates.
In respect of a request for correction, if I think the correction is reasonable and I am reasonably able to change the personal information, I will make the correction. If I do not make the correction, I will take reasonable steps to note on the personal information that you requested the correction.
If you want to exercise either of the above rights, email me at [liz@kuakatranslations.co.nz](mailto:liz@kuakatranslations.co.nz). Your email should provide evidence of who you are and set out the details of your request (e.g. the personal information, or the correction, that you are requesting).
I may charge you reasonable costs of providing you copies of your personal information or correcting that information.

## Internet use

While I take reasonable steps to maintain secure internet connections, if you provide me with personal information over the internet, the provision of that information is at your own risk.
If you follow a link on my website to another site, the owner of that site will have its own privacy policy relating to your personal information. I suggest you review that site’s privacy policy before you provide personal information.

I am passionate about translating – I love the challenge of creating a translation that sounds natural in English. I am committed to providing high quality translations that are fit for purpose.

I am an English speaker, born in New Zealand but fluent in Japanese after a number of years of study and over five years living in Japan (Sapporo and Kanazawa). I make regular visits to refresh my knowledge of Japanese life and language.

I also regularly attend translation conferences to maintain my skills and keep up-to-date with professional news and developments – for example, the FIT (International Federation of Translators) Congress in Brisbane, Australia (August, 2017) and NZSTI (New Zealand Society of Translators and Interpreters) Conferences.

### Background to Kuaka Translations and the Kuaka Logo

Kuaka means bar-tailed godwit in Māori. The godwits are a migratory bird that fly from New Zealand to Alaska to breed, via Asian countries including Japan. This connection between North and South mirrors my Japanese to English translation work.

## Kuaka Translations is the trading name of Elizabeth Sekizaki. \[photo of me\]

I am passionate about translating – I love the challenge of creating a translation that sounds natural in English. I am committed to providing high quality translations that are fit for purpose.

I am an English speaker, born in New Zealand but fluent in Japanese after a number of years of study and over five years living in Japan (Sapporo and Kanazawa). I make regular visits to refresh my knowledge of Japanese life and language.

Qualifications:

* BA in Japanese (Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand)
* Postgraduate Diploma in Translation Studies (University of Auckland, New Zealand)
* Member (Full) for Japanese to English, of the New Zealand Society for Translators and Interpreters or (NZSTI)
* Translations accepted by the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA), New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) and Immigration New Zealand
* I have been translating since 2003

My experience includes translating and revising/editing a variety of texts. I have knowledge of what New Zealand Immigration requires and I also have several years’ experience translating Japanese medical journal articles.

Background to Kuaka Translations and the Kuaka Logo

Kuaka means bar-tailed godwit in Maori. The godwits are a migratory bird that fly from New Zealand to Alaska to breed, via Asian countries including Japan. This connection between North and South mirrors my Japanese to English translation work.
